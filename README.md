# Vue 3, Vite & GitHub Pages hosted SPA template
## What is it?
It's a setup with:
- Dev server: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) ‚ö°Ô∏è.
- Framework: [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) with [Vue Router Next](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router-next).
- Hosting: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with a crawler-proof SPA hack (no SEO penalties).
- Automated deployments using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- (optional) [pnpm](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) for managing Node.js packages. Why? Because it's strict, secure and faaaast üöÄ.
  - If you prefer using `npm` or `yarn`, just replace `pnpm` in the `"scripts"` section in `package.json` with your preferred package manager, and change the GitHub Actions workflow to stop using `pnpm`.

## Setup
Just create a new repository using this template, run `pnpm i` (or `npm` etc.) and you can start working immediately.

### Production config
- Make sure to set the `--base` flag in the `build:prod` script in `package.json` to your production base path.
- Also, edit `public/404.html` and change `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL='INSERT_BASE_URL_HERE'"></meta>` to use your production base path as well.

## How does it work?
Builds will be made automatically after pushing to `master`, using a GitHub Actions workflow. They will also be deployed to GitHub Pages automatically, by pushing them to the `gh-pages` branch. All _you_ need to do is setup GitHub Pages on your repository.

## Bonus
The template contains a bonus component called `<preloadable-router-link>`, that can be used instead of `<router-link>` to preload dynamically imported route components on link hover.
